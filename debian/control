Description: freeze persistence service C++ run-time
 Internet Communications Engins (Ice) is a comprehensive RPC framework
 that helps you build distributed applications with minimal
 effort. Ice takes care of all interactions with low-level network
 programming interfaces and allows you to focus your efforts on your
 application logic. When using Ice, there is no need to worry about
 details such as opening network connections, serializing and
 deserializing data for network transmission, or retrying failed
 connection attempts (to name just a few of dozens of such low-level
 details).
 .
 This package contains the freeze persistence service C++ run-time.
