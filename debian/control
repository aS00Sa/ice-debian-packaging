Description: Ice (Internet Communications Engine)
 Ice is a comprehensive RPC framework that helps you build distributed
 applications with minimal effort using familiar object-oriented idioms.
 Ice handles all interactions with low-level network programming
 interfaces so that you can focus your efforts on your application logic.
 When using Ice, there is no need to worry about details such as opening
 network connections, serializing and deserializing data for network
 transmission, or retrying failed connection attempts (just to name a
 few things).
